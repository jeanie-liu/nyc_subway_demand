# NYC Subway Demand Prediction

## About the Project
Our project revolves around addressing the multifaceted concerns of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) regarding the subway system. The three key areas of inquiry include:
* **Understanding Current Subway Traffic Patterns and Demographics**: We embarked on an analysis of subway turnstile data spanning several years to discern the prevailing traffic patterns across New York City, both holistically and at the neighborhood level. Moreover, we explored the interplay between subway demand and demographic factors, particularly assessing the impact of COVID-19 on ridership trends.

* **Predicting Future Subway Demand**: Anticipating future demand for the subway system is crucial for informed decision-making regarding infrastructure investments and repairs. Leveraging our analytical insights, we aimed to forecast subway demand and identify the stations deserving of prioritized attention from the city.

* **Informing Strategic Investments**: In alignment with the city's broader goals, we explored the potential for revenue generation through the establishment of city-owned convenient stores adjacent to subway stations. Our analysis sought to determine the optimal types of stores to build and their strategic placement based on neighborhood characteristics and consumer preferences.
